## Recommendations 

- As provided from analysis that more deaths resulted from lack of medical access than direct impact, emergency services should be put in place in hospitals by provision of first aid services, most importantly blood and fluid, to keep victims alive before accessing medical care at the hospital.

## Data Limitation and Caveats 

- Data context- This is synthetic data and does not in any way paint the true picture of the impact of the Gaza War.
- Data completeness- There isnâ€™t any information about Property destructions, displacement of citizens as a result of the war, and other important things that could have resulted due to the war impact.
